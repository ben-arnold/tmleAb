Description: Targeted maximum likelihood estimation for antibody measurements in R. In addition to estimating age-dependent
    antibody curves, the tmleAb package makes it easy to estimate marginally
    adjusted means from the curves, and compare marginally adjusted means between
    populations. This package is first and foremost a convenience wrapper: the heavy lifting for machine
    learning is conducted using the \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}} package, and statistical estimation
    is conducted using the \code{\link[tmle]{tmle}} package.
    However, it also provides easy access to parametric modeling methods applied to antibody data.
