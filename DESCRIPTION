Description: Targeted maximum likelihood estimation for antibody measurements in
    R. In addition to estimating age-dependent antibody curves with ensemble machine learning, the tmleAb package
    makes it easier to estimate marginally adjusted means from the curves, and compare
    marginally adjusted means between populations. This package is mainly a
    convenience wrapper: the heavy lifting for machine learning is conducted using
    the \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}} package, and statistical estimation
    is conducted using the \code{\link[tmle]{tmle}} package. However, it also
    provides access to parametric modeling methods applied to antibody data.
