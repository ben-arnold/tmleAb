Title: Targeted maximum likelihood estimation for antibody (Ab) measurements
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Ben", "Arnold", email = "benarnold@berkeley.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Targeted maximum likelihood estimation for antibody data in R. In addition to estimating age-dependent
    antibody curves, the tmleAb package makes it easy to estimate marginally
    adjusted means from the curves, and compare marginally adjusted means between
    populations. This package is mainly a wrapper: the heavy lifting for machine
    learning is conducted using the \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}} package, and statistical estimation
    is conducted using the \code{\link[tmle]{tmle}} package.
