Description: Ensemble machine learning (Super Learning) to fit
    age-dependent antibody curves in R. In addition to estimating age-dependent
    antibody curves, the SLAb package makes it easy to estimate marginally
    adjusted means from the curves, and compare marginally adjusted means between
    populations. This package is mainly a wrapper: the heavy lifting for machine
    learning is conducted using the \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}} package, and statistical estimation
    is conducted using the \code{\link[tmle]{tmle}} package.
