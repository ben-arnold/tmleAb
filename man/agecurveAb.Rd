\title{Fit an age-dependent antibody curve with ensemble machine learning}
\usage{
agecurveAb(Y, Age, W = NULL, id = NULL, family = gaussian(),
  SL.library = c("SL.mean", "SL.glm", "SL.gam", "SL.loess"),
  RFnodesize = NULL, gamdf = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Antibody measurement. Must be a numeric vector.}

\item{Age}{Age of the individual at the time of measurement. Must be a numeric vector.}

\item{W}{An optional vector, matrix, or data.frame of covariates for each individual used to marginally adjust the curve}

\item{id}{An optional cluster or repeated measures id variable. For cross-validation splits, \code{id} forces observations in the same cluster or for the same individual to be in the same validation fold.}

\item{family}{Model family (gaussian for continuous outcomes, binomial for binary outcomes)}

\item{SL.library}{Library of algorithms to include in the ensemble (see the \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}} package for details).}

\item{RFnodesize}{Optional argument to specify a range of minimum node sizes for the random Forest algorithm. If \code{SL.library} includes \code{SL.randomForest}, then the default is to search over node sizes of 15,20,...40. Specifying this option will override the default.}

\item{gamdf}{Optional argument to specify a range of degrees of freedom for natural smoothing splines in a generalized additive model. If \code{SL.library} includes \code{SL.gam}, then the default is to search over a range of df=2-10. Specifying this option will override the default.}
}
\value{
{\code{pY}} {Vector of predicted mean antibody levels for the individual, same length as \code{Y}. If adjusted by \code{W}, then \code{pY} includes the marginally adjusted prediction at Age=a.}

{\code{Y}} {Returns \code{Y} in the same format as its argument.}

{\code{Age}} {Returns \code{Age} in the same format as its argument.}

{\code{W}} {Returns \code{W} in the same format as its argument.}

{\code{id}} {Returns \code{id} in the same format as its argument.}

{\code{pYframe}} {An object of class data.frame that includes the actual dataset (feature matrix) used for estimation, along with fitted results (\code{pY}). Note that the estimation dataset excludes any observations with missing values in \code{Y}, \code{Age}, \code{W} (if not NULL), or \code{id} (if specified). Factors in \code{W} are converted to design-matrix-style indicator variables.}
}
\description{
\code{agecurveAb} uses ensemble machine learning with \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}} to fit population mean antibody curves by age. If covariates \code{W} are included, the predicted curve is marginally adjusted for \code{W}.
}
\details{
The \code{agecurveAb} function is a wrapper for \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}} that provides a convenient interface for this specific estimation problem. If the \code{SL.library} argument includes just one model or algorithm, then there is no 'ensemble' but the function provides a standard interface for using single algorithms (e.g., \code{\link[stats]{SL.loess}})  Note that if \code{SL.randomForest} is included in the library, \code{agecurveAb} will select the minimum node size (between 15 and 40) with cross-validation to avoid over-fitting. If you wish to control the randomForest node size options using a range other than 15-40, you can do so by passing an argument \code{RFnodesize} through this function. Similarly, if \code{SL.gam} is included in the library, \code{agecurveAb} will select the optimal degrees of freedom for natural splines (between 2 and 10) with cross-validation to get the correct amount of smoothing.  If you wish to control the GAM df search, you can do so by passing an argument \code{gamdf} through this function.
